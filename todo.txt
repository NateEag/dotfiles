2020-07-16 Change bin/timezone-date-converter to accept timezone identifiers as separate arguments from the datetime string itself, so I can use this logic to reliably convert between all timezone names: https://crashcourse.housegordon.org/gnu-date-timezones.html Would also make it easier to add tab completion for timezones.

2020-06-02 Add support for concatenating multiple crontab files at install time. At $DAYJOBs I may want to run work-specific cron jobs on my machine as a workaround for not having sane places to do it, and that obviously doesn't belong in my dotfiles.

2020-01-22 Add a keybinding to create a new reminder in Reminders.app. An unfinished stab at this is in bin/add-reminder.

2019-10-16 Automatically trigger notification on prompt display if the previous command took more than four seconds to run? I could build this via PROMPT_COMMAND. Not sure it's a great idea since I'd get notified whenever I intentionally kill a long-running process I spawned interactively, but it would be handy for all the times I kick off a build of X, Y, or Z and move on to something else for a minute or two. Bob Stouffer pointed out I could start this at ten seconds and reduce it from there as seems reasonable.

2019-03-11 Filter emails based on dumb keywords - if it contains the text "Unsubscribe", there's a good chance I don't want to read it. Hat tip: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19328189

2019-02-11 Get High Sierra to wake / end screensaver on keyboard input. This seems to be an unacknowledged bug, which can be worked around by giving each external monitor its own Space (yuck): https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/320402/307408

2017-12-18 Figure out how to use multiple password stores with pass (e.g., work and personal). Turns out the answer is the built-in `-p`, which lets you specify a different GPG key for a subfolder. Remaining questions: is there a smart way to manage subfolders (so I can just check out my personal repo as a subrepo or something), and can I get gpg-agent to expire some keys faster than others?

2016-10-27 Figure out a way to get notified when third-party files are updated (for instance, lib/git-svn.sh). A list of RSS feed URLs that install.sh subscribes to is the obvious way, I guess, but arbitrary software doesn't necessarily have an RSS feed for updates.

2013-06-26 Tweak my bash history setup based on this post: http://www.talug.org/events/20030709/cmdline_history.html

2013-06-26 Figure out how to make git grep colorize output when being routed through a terminal.
