2019-02-11 Get High Sierra to wake / end screensaver on keyboard input. This
seems to be an unacknowledged bug, which can be worked around by giving each
external monitor its own Space (yuck):

2018-02-16 Load expensive bash extensions (nvm, pyenv, etc) in background if
possible. I think you could probably abuse PROMPT_COMMAND to save "last
interaction time" and a sleeping poll loop to see when you're inactive then
kick off a load.

2017-12-18 Figure out how to use multiple password stores with pass (e.g., work
and personal). I guess one answer could be setting PASSWORD_STORE_DIR with
direnv in, say, ~/personal/.envrc, except direnv does not have great support
for nested direnvs. Maybe I can add something to ~/direnvrc to get me there (or
just skip direnv and add my own bash hook for setting env vars in ~/personal).

2016-10-27 Figure out a way to get notified when third-party files are updated
(for instance, lib/git-svn.sh). A list of RSS feed URLs that install.sh
subscribes to is the obvious way, I guess, but arbitrary software doesn't
necessarily have an RSS feed for updates.

2013-06-26 Figure out how to make git grep colorize output when being routed through a terminal.
