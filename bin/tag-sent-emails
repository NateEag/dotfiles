help_msg="Tag emails sent via Emacs' notmuch interface sanely.

As of this writing, when you send an email in notmuch's Emacs interface, it's
tagged as 'inbox' and 'unread'.

'inbox' might make some sense, but 'unread'? For something you sent?

This script is part of my workaround, and is meant to be called from Emacs."

primary_email="$(notmuch config get user.primary_email)"
notmuch tag -unread -- "from:$primary_email" and is:unread
