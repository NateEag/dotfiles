# I've started experimenting with mbsync for fetching mail on my work machine.
#
# It seems to be faster and cleaner than offlineimap, but it doesn't have hooks
# built-in.
#
# Therefore, I have this tiny wrapper script to simulate that job.

mbsync "$1"

# TODO I should arguably just call my offlineimap-postsync script in here. In
# turn, I guess that script should maybe just be named 'check-mail-postsync',
# since it's actually just running after syncs, no matter what program you use
# for the syncing.
