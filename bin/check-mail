# I've started experimenting with mbsync for fetching mail on my work machine.
#
# It seems to be faster and cleaner than offlineimap, but it doesn't have hooks
# built-in.
#
# Therefore, I have this tiny wrapper script to simulate that job.

# Error out if GPG doesn't have authorization for a key linked to the active
# email address in this session.
#
# The technique, which works only with GPG 2, was found on SO:
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/342461
#
# TODO Figure out a more elegant way to check this.
