# Install Syncthing launchd job.

# Only useful on Mac OS X, obviously.
#
# Keep in mind that since I have saved the launchd template it could get out of
# sync with the upstream (which was extracted from
# https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases/download/v1.19.0/syncthing-macos-universal-v1.19.0.zip
# and tweaked to meet my needs).
#
# Note that syncthing.plist specifies the config dir explicitly, because I want
# to keep my config files under version control in this repo, and on Mac OS X
# it defaults to putting them in a different place.
