#! /usr/bin/env bash

# A stupid workaround for the fact that I'm having a hard time getting Chrome
# to work with chrome-pass on my home machine.
#
# Instead of doing it the right way, by setting the environment with launchd,
# I'm just adding this script I can Spotlight for on the rare occasions Chrome
# is not open (mostly after restarts, really).
