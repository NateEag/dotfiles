msg="Announce today's goal in team chat, or admit it if you haven't set one.

If '$last_announced_path' contains today's date, exit without doing anything,
because an announcement has already been made.

If a file exists at '$goal_path', send its contents to the team chat, insert
today's date in '$last_announced_path', and delete '$goal_path'.

If '$goal_path' does not exist, send the team the message '$no_goal_today'

If you schedule this to execute early in your workday, it provides incentive
for you to actually define a goal, to avoid embarrassment. Further, your
manager will likely ask you what you actually *are* doing, since you just said
you don't know.

(Obviously it can be trivially worked around, but so can any system - this is
just a nudge in the right direction.)

Depends on some other tools I have living in my dotfiles.
