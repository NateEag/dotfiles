msg="A bash script for choosing one of several options at pseudorandom.

I use it to help me make decisions.

The decision-making algorithm is:

When uncertain which of two options to choose, flip a coin. If you feel bad
about the outcome, you now know you wanted the other one. Choose it, and carry
on.

By the magic of software, your coin may have as many faces as you like. It even
allows you to simulate the fabled three-sided die.

The script is named for the decision-making algorithm, not for literally
modeling coin flips.

With no arguments, outputs one of 'Heads' or 'Tails'.

With arguments, outputs exactly one of them to stdout.

Usage: $0 [<choice>...]"

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    choices=(Heads Tails)
else
    choices=( "$@" )
fi

num_choices="${#choices[@]}"

((index=RANDOM % num_choices))

echo "${choices[$index]}"
