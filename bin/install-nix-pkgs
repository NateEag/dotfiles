# A small script to create and configure my personal Nix environment per
# .config/nixpkgs/config.nix in this repository.
#
# The -r flag has forced me to explicitly list some packages I otherwise
# wouldn't need to. I'm using it to increase the odds of a cleanly-reproducible
# environment, so that I don't do anything interactively at some point that I
# come to depend on without realizing it.
