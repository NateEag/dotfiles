Only works on Mac OS X, and then only if terminal-notifier is installed.

It should be easy enough to port to other platforms next time I'm on one of them.

A number of the scripts in my dotfiles depend on this for letting me know if
something interesting has happened.

It's also handy in its own right, usually for letting me ignore slow commands
until they've either succeeded or failed.

Usage: $script_name <message> [<title>]"

if [ "$1" = '--help' ]; then
    echo "$help_msg"

    exit
elif [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "$help_msg" >&2

    exit 2
fi


title='Notification'
if [ -n "$2" ]; then
    title="$2"
fi

terminal-notifier -message "$1" -title "$title"
