# Command to abstract sending a graphical notification message from the terminal.
#
# I always forget the syntax for doing this, so I'm introducing this tiny
# command.
#
# As time passes I expect I'll wind up expanding this to work on platforms
# besides OS X.
#
# I mostly use it when I'm running a slow process in an interactive terminal
# and want to be notified when it's done.
