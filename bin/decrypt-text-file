msg="Decrypt file at <filepath> using GPG.

The file's contents will be written to stdout, so be careful what you use it for.

I use it as a workaround for GPG pinentry not working correctly when I open an
encrypted text document in emacs. For whatever reason, decrypting it this way
gets pinentry to trigger in my terminal session, and once the relevant key has
been loaded, then Emacs can decrypt the text file successfully.

Usage: $script_name <filepath>"

if [ $1 == '--help' ]; then
    echo "$msg"

    exit
elif [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "$msg" >&2

    exit 1
fi

filepath="$1"

gpg -q --decrypt "$filepath"
