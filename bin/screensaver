#! /bin/bash

# Idiotic workaround for my funky keyboard shortcut setup sending an event after
# I hit the binding that triggers this script, and thus waking it up
# immediately after it's gone to sleep:
#
# just sleep for a half-second before starting the screensaver.
#
# I feel guilty about this hack, but I'm not clear where the actual failure
# lies and I'm not sure how to figure out.
#
# It was definitely brought on by a change to my keyboard firmware this
# morning, so it's probably at fault. However, the only symptom so far is the
# screensaver getting woken up right after invocation, which feels like an
# extra keystroke getting set, and that only happens when I have Slate running,
# which in turn is eating whatever event wakes things back up. The events never
# make it to EventViewer if Slate's running, and when it's not nothing seems to
# be wrong, so it's just conceivable that it's something weird about how Slate
# and my tap-dance key setup are interacting.
#
# If I find any other issues being caused by my custom firmware, I'll roll up my
# sleeves and dig into it.
