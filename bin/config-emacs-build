# On OS X Mojave, /usr/share/emacs/ contains elisp that causes make-process to
# take at least five seconds before actually creating the child process.

# Because the only runtime way to skip loading site files is to pass
# --no-site-file (see
# https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html),
# I've added the below to my personal build configuration, so that my Emacs
# builds ignore site files. A wrapper binary that always passes --no-site-file
# doesn't play well with OS X's Emacs.app, and editing or removing the site
# files themselves means bypassing SIP on Mojave, which didn't seem ideal.
