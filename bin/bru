# A thin wrapper around the brew command.
#
# It has one (primary) purpose, to record interactive installs/uninstalls of
# packages.
#
# This way, I don't have to remember to track what I've installed myself.
#
# As far as I've found, Homebrew has no built-in hooks to support this:
#
# https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/24907
#
# and yes, I know that's the old repo, but I saw nothing about it in the
# current one.
#
# Note that it seems to remember packages installed via taps. I'm not sure, but
# it looks like a package's tap name might be 'beginning of string through last
# /'.
