# Note to self: sometimes you know you'll be working with multiple repositories
# over HTTPS, and the server's cert is self-signed. Rather than telling git "don't
# verify SSL connections", or "use this cert for this repo" repeatedly, copy your
# machine's global cert bundle to some private location, and add each cert you
# want to trust to that file. Then, set http.sslCAInfo to point to that file.
# That way, you'll be warned in event of man-in-the-middle attacks in future.
