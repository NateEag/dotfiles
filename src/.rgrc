# I use ripgrep (a.k.a. rg) for search preferentially. I am annoyed that it
# insists on ignoring dotfiles by default, as some tools store per-project
# plaintext configurations in dotfiles (e.g. GitHub Actions using `.github` for
# its config files).
#
# Since rg has explicitly rejected support for searching hidden files by default
# (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/623), I have the below option:
--hidden

# ...that said, who wants to search the contents of their .git dirs all the
# time?
--glob
!.git
