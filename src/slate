# N.B.: There's a known bug where you cannot resize windows that are flush with
# the right edge of the screen:

# https://github.com/jigish/slate/issues/259
#
# The easiest workaround is to shrink right-side windows to the left, expand
# them to the right a few times, then throw them back to the right.
